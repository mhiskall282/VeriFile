# Documentation Index

This `docs/` directory contains developer-focused documentation and an indexed overview of the codebase.

Files:

- `architecture.md` — high-level architecture and data flow between client, server and blockchain.
- `client.md` — notes about the frontend, important components, and where verification UI lives.
- `server.md` — server routes, middleware, and configuration details.
- `hardhat.md` — instructions for running Hardhat, compiling, testing and deploying with ignition.
- `contracts.md` — the WorkHistory contract overview and notable functions.
- `api.md` — API endpoint descriptions, expected payloads and example requests/responses.

Start with `architecture.md` for the big picture, then open `client.md` and `server.md` for implementation details.
